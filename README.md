# Economic Charting
## Plot #1

This is text I have floating in space. I would like to print a `picture` below.
![Plot #1](plots/plot_cpi.png)

Can we make this plot any smaller?<br />
<img src="plots/plot_cpi.png" alt="Plot #1b" width="400"/>
Do I need to add in another line break here? Certainly so.

# Plot #2
