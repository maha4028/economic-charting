# Economic Charting

## Plot #1

I will be plotting the [Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1wmdD) and the [Unemployment Rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) from FRED via the `quantmod` library.

<!-- Can we make this plot any smaller?

Do I need to add in another line break here? Certainly so. -->

# Plot #2

The solid lines below show the percent change from a year ago in the consumer price index (CPI) and the unemployment rate. The dashed red and blue lines are the "natural rate of unemployment" and the Fed's target for annual inflation, respectively. 

Although the exact figure for the "natural rate of unemployment" is unkown - it usually hovers between four and five percent. Below, I plotted it at 5%. The inflation target is plotted at 2%.
